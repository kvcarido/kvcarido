💫 Hi, I'm Kayleen (she / her) – I'm a first-generation Filipina from Queens, New York with a forever-the-student approach to life. An autodidact since my early days on the internet, I'm interested in open source, digital communities, and how data tells a story. Offline I enjoy learning about urban gardening 🌱, teaching my dog new tricks 🐕, and rooting for the New York Knicks 🏀.

## Currently...
...exploring the possibilities of data engineering 

...re-building my website using [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev)
