💫 Hi, I'm Kayleen (she / her) – I'm a first-generation Filipina from Queens, New York with a boundless desire to explore and learn. An autodidact since my early days on the internet, my curiosities range within all things frontend, open source, and inclusive digital communities. 

## Currently...
...working with API calls and best practices for dealing with sensitive information that comes along with it (hello, API keys) building an [Animal Crossing Village Guide](https://github.com/kvcarido/acnh-villager-guide). Check out my progress so far!
